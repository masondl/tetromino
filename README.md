# tetromino
Clone of classic Tetris game. Nothing interesting about the implementation (it's not great), I just did it for fun and to get familiar with SFML.

Must set a valid FONT_PATH in TetrominoUI.hpp

The logic for rotating blocks in particular could be greately improved...

To play:
Right/Left/Down - move piece
Up              - drop piece
Spacebar        - rotate piece
Left alt        - hold

The top 4 rows are the 'dead zone', if a piece is placed there the game is over.
